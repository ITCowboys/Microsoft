So buckle up and get ready for a ride into the deep of Microsoft Defender for Office 365 with the ITCowboys!

## Preset Security Policies

Microsoft Defender for Office 365 offers Preset Security Policies as a way to streamline the configuration of security settings and improve the protection against threats like phishing, malware, and other malicious attacks targeted at an organization's Office 365 environments, including email and collaboration tools. These preset policies are designed to simplify the administration of security measures by providing predefined security settings that can be quickly applied to an organization's environment. Here's a brief technical summary of Preset Security Policies within Microsoft Defender for Office 365:

**Key Components**

- **Standard Protection**: This preset is designed for general protection and is aimed at organizations needing a balance between security and usability. It provides a solid level of security against common threats without significantly impacting user productivity.
- **Strict Protection**: Aimed at higher-risk environments, this preset offers more stringent security measures. It is designed for organizations that are more likely to be targeted by attacks or those that handle sensitive information. The strict preset applies more aggressive settings to ensure maximum protection at the cost of potential false positives and a slight impact on usability.

**Recommended Values**

In the Microsoft Security Center -> Email & Collaboration -> Policies -> Preset Security Policies we recommend the following:

- Turn of Standard and Strict Protection
- Exclude your domains from the Built-in Protection

Since we are going to create our own Policies within Microsoft Defender for Office 365 we don’t need the Standard, Strict or Built-in Policies to conflict with your custom ones Based on Best Practices 😊

With Powershell you can view the individual security policies for the Built-in protection preset security policy, run this command:

Get-ATPBuiltInProtectionRule

## Configuration Analyzer

Microsoft Defender for Office 365, formerly known as Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection, includes a feature called Configuration Analyzer. This tool is designed to help organizations ensure their Microsoft Defender for Office 365 settings are configured optimally to protect against threats. Here's a brief technical summary of Configuration Analyzer:

**Purpose**

The Configuration Analyzer is intended to help IT administrators and security professionals evaluate and improve their security posture by analyzing the current configuration settings of Microsoft Defender for Office 365 against Microsoft's recommended best practices.

**Key Features**

- **Comparison Against Best Practices:** It compares the organization's current Defender for Office 365 configuration settings against Microsoft's recommended best practices.
- **Security Recommendations:** Provides actionable recommendations for adjusting configurations that are not aligned with best practices, potentially improving the organization’s security posture.
- **Customization:** Recognizes that not all recommendations can be universally applied, allowing for exceptions based on the organization's specific needs and risk tolerance.
- **Reporting:** Offers detailed reports that outline current configurations, how they differ from recommended settings, and the potential impact of aligning with those recommendations.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Encourages an iterative approach to security posture improvement by regularly reviewing and updating configurations as new threats emerge and best practices evolve.

**Recommendations**

We highly recommend that you know of the existence and capacities of the Configuration Analyzer withing Microsoft Defender for Office 365. Next to the Configuration Analyzer there is a Powershell Module called ORCA. ORCA is a module that scan’s you Microsoft Defender for Office 365 policies and gives you (a little more detailed) information where you are able to improve.

We don’t recommend using the Configuration Analyzer or ORCA scan at this but it will come in handy in de future when you have deployed your own Best-Practices and Configuration within Microsoft Defender for Office 365. With this overview you are able to get insight into configuration drifts and changes. Is is a great addition to your documentation 😊
