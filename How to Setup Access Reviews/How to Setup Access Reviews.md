# How to Setup Access Reviews

## What is Microsoft Entra Access Reviews

Microsoft Entra Access Reviews is a feature within the Microsoft Entra suite designed to help organizations efficiently manage and secure identities and access across various applications and services. This tool is pivotal in ensuring that users have appropriate access rights and in maintaining compliance with internal and external regulations. Here's a concise technical summary of its key functionalities:

1. **Automated Review Campaigns**: Access Reviews allows organizations to automate the process of reviewing user access to resources, such as Azure AD groups, Azure AD applications, and SharePoint Online sites. This automation helps in regularly assessing and verifying the necessity of access rights assigned to users.
1. **Comprehensive Oversight**: It provides a centralized view for administrators to track and manage access reviews, making it easier to identify excessive or inappropriate permissions that might pose a security risk.
1. **Configurable Settings**: Administrators can tailor access review campaigns based on specific requirements, such as defining the frequency of reviews, selecting the scope of review (e.g., specific groups or applications), and determining who should perform the review (e.g., group owners, application owners, or the users themselves).
1. **Delegation and Collaboration**: The tool supports delegating the review process to the actual owners of the resources, fostering accountability and ensuring that those with the most knowledge of the resource are making access decisions. It also allows for collaboration among reviewers, enhancing the accuracy of access reviews.
1. **Actionable Insights and Remediation**: Upon completion of a review, Access Reviews provides actionable insights, including recommendations for removing unnecessary access. It can automate the process of revoking access, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and ensuring compliance with least privilege principles.
1. **Integration with Governance Policies**: Access Reviews is integrated with Microsoft Entra’s governance policies, supporting broader identity governance strategies. This integration helps in enforcing access policies and compliance standards across the organization.
1. **Reporting and Compliance**: It offers detailed reporting capabilities, enabling organizations to audit access reviews, monitor compliance with access policies, and demonstrate adherence to regulatory requirements.
